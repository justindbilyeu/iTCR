## Common Customer Objections & Responses

### "Metal is too expensive"
**Response:** "I understand. Let me show you the 30-year analysis. Metal costs $27,500 today, but you save $600/year on insurance and $180/year on energy, and you never replace it. Over 30 years, you actually spend less than the cheaper options because you're not paying for replacements."

### "Why not just go with 3-tab?"
**Response:** "3-tab definitely works if upfront cost is your priority. The trade-off is you'll likely replace it twice in 30 years instead of once, and you don't get insurance savings. If you're staying long-term, architectural actually costs less total. But if you're selling in 5-10 years, 3-tab makes sense."

### "Aren't all shingles basically the same?"
**Response:** "They're all asphalt shingles, but the quality difference is significant. Architectural is thicker, more impact-resistant, lasts longer, and looks better. Think of it like cars—they all have four wheels, but a Honda and a Kia have real differences in quality and longevity."

### "I want the best, but I can't afford metal"
**Response:** "Architectural is a great middle ground. You get Class 4 impact resistance (same as metal), good insurance savings, 30-year lifespan, and it costs half as much upfront. You'll replace it once in 30 years instead of never, but it's still an excellent roof."
