**What is iTCR?**
Your AI-powered roofing estimation assistant that generates professional multi-product quotes in under 10 minutes from photos.

**How to Access:**
[Link to be provided by management]

**What You Need:**
- Overhead photos of the roof
- Property address
- Basic customer preferences
- 5-10 minutes

---

## The 5-Minute iTCR Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Photos (2 minutes)

**Required:**
- [ ] Overhead/aerial view (Google Maps satellite works!)
- [ ] Entire roof visible

**Helpful:**
- [ ] Side angles showing pitch
- [ ] Reference objects (car, garage door)
- [ ] Current roof condition photos

**Photo Tips:**
- Use Google Maps satellite view if you don't have aerial photos
- Screenshot from property listing photos
- Ask customer to send photos from second story window
- Look for cars in driveway (gives scale reference)

### Step 2: Open iTCR & Upload (30 seconds)

1. Click your iTCR Custom GPT link
2. Click the paperclip icon to upload photos
3. Select all roof photos

### Step 3: Provide Information (1 minute)

**Type or copy/paste:**
```
Please generate a multi-product roofing quote for:
- Address: [street address, city, zip]
- Current roof: [shingles / metal / unknown]
- Customer priorities: [budget / longevity / insurance savings / not sure]
- Any concerns: [hail damage / energy costs / specific needs]
```

**Example:**
```
Please generate a multi-product roofing quote for:
- Address: 123 Oak Street, Austin, TX 78703
- Current roof: architectural shingles
- Customer priorities: concerned about hail, long-term value
- Any concerns: wants to lower insurance premiums
```

### Step 4: Review Output (2-3 minutes)

iTCR will provide:
- [ ] Estimated square footage
- [ ] Recommended products (usually 2-3 options)
- [ ] Detailed cost breakdown for each
- [ ] ROI analysis (insurance, energy, longevity)
- [ ] 30-year cost comparison

**Quick Checks:**
- Does square footage seem reasonable?
- Are costs within expected range?
- Is confidence score High or Medium?

**If Low Confidence:**
- iTCR will flag it and recommend on-site verification
- Still useful as preliminary estimate

### Step 5: Present to Customer (5+ minutes)

**Recommended Approach:**

1. **Start with the problem:**
   "Here's what your roof replacement looks like. Let me show you three options and why each might work for you."

2. **Show the comparison:**
   Present the 30-year cost of ownership table
   "Notice how metal costs more upfront but actually costs less over 30 years when you factor in insurance savings and no replacement."

3. **Educate on ROI:**
   Walk through insurance savings, energy efficiency, replacement cycles
   "You're saving $XXX per year on insurance with Class 4 metal. That's $X,XXX over 30 years."

4. **Let customer decide:**
   Don't push—present options and let numbers speak
   "Which of these options aligns best with your priorities?"

## Taking Effective Photos

### What Makes a Good Photo?

**Good:**
- Clear overhead view
- Entire roof visible
- Can see roof features (valleys, dormers)
- Reference objects visible (car, garage)
- Good lighting

**Poor:**
- Ground-level only
- Obstructed by trees
- Partial roof view
- Too far away to see detail
- Dark/shadowed

### Photo Sources

**Option 1: Google Maps Satellite View (Easiest)**
1. Go to Google Maps
2. Enter property address
3. Switch to Satellite view
4. Zoom in until roof fills screen
5. Screenshot

**Option 2: Property Listing Photos**
- Real estate listings often have aerial photos
- Zillow, Realtor.com usually have good angles

**Option 3: Customer-Provided**
- Ask customer to take photos from upstairs window
- Ask if they have drone photos
- Check if they have roof inspection photos

**Option 4: On-Site (During Visit)**
- Climb ladder for overhead angle
- Use phone to capture roof from elevated position
- Get multiple angles

### Reference Objects for Scale

**iTCR looks for:**
- Cars (~16 feet long)
- Garage doors (~16-18 feet wide)
- Standard doors (~3 feet wide)
- Windows (~4 feet wide)

**Pro Tip:** Point these out to iTCR if not obvious in photos:
"There's a car in the driveway that's about 16 feet long for scale reference."

## Product Recommendations Guide

### When to Recommend Metal Roofing

**Strong Fit:**
- Customer mentioned hail concerns
- High-value home ($500K+)
- Plans to stay long-term (10+ years)
- Insurance savings important
- Energy efficiency valued
- Zip codes: 78703, 78730, 78746 (high hail frequency)

**How to Position:**
"Based on your hail concerns and long-term ownership, metal roofing makes a lot of sense. Yes, it's $X,XXX more upfront, but you'll save $XXX per year on insurance and never need to replace it again. Over 30 years, you actually come out ahead."

### When to Recommend Architectural Shingles

**Strong Fit:**
- Mid-budget customer
- 10-20 year ownership plan
- Wants better than basic, not ready for premium
- Appreciates aesthetics
- Standard residential upgrade

**How to Position:**
"Architectural shingles are the sweet spot for most customers. Better curb appeal than 3-tab, solid warranty, and reasonable cost. You'll likely get one more replacement out of them if you're here 25+ years."

### When to Recommend 3-Tab Shingles

**Strong Fit:**
- Budget-constrained
- Rental property
- Short-term ownership (<10 years)
- Just need basic code compliance
- Insurance claim with limited payout

**How to Position:**
"3-tab shingles get the job done at the lowest cost. They'll last 15-20 years, meet all code requirements, and if you're not planning to be here long-term, they make financial sense."

### Always Show Comparison

**Even if customer says "just the cheapest":**
Show them 3-tab AND architectural side-by-side
Let them see what the extra $X,XXX gets them
Sometimes seeing the small difference changes minds

**Even if customer says "give me the best":**
Show them metal AND architectural
Let them see what they're paying for
Transparency builds trust

## Handling Customer Questions

### "Why is this so expensive?"

**Don't:**
- Get defensive
- Apologize for pricing
- Offer discounts (not your call)

**Do:**
- Show the breakdown: "Let me show you exactly where that money goes..."
- Compare to competition: "This is market rate for this quality in Austin."
- Show long-term value: "Over 30 years, this actually costs less because..."

**Script:**
"I know it seems like a lot upfront. Here's the breakdown: $X for materials, $Y for labor, $Z for permits and disposal. That's all transparent in the quote. And when you look at 30 years, factoring in insurance savings and no replacement, it's actually cheaper than multiple cheap roofs."

### "Can you do it cheaper?"

**Don't:**
- Reduce price on the spot
- Offer to "cut corners"

**Do:**
- Show less expensive options: "We can do 3-tab instead of architectural and save $X,XXX"
- Explain what changes: "Here's what's different..."
- Maintain quality: "I can get you a lower price, but I won't compromise on quality that'll cause problems later."

**Script:**
"I can absolutely work with your budget. Let me show you the 3-tab option—it's $X,XXX less. The trade-off is a shorter lifespan and less insurance savings, but if upfront cost is the priority, this works. What's most important to you?"

### "How accurate is this AI estimate?"

**Don't:**
- Oversell accuracy ("100% perfect!")
- Dismiss concern ("Don't worry about it")

**Do:**
- Be honest: "It's very good—typically within 5-10% of final costs."
- Show confidence score: "The AI rated this estimate as [High/Medium] confidence."
- Offer verification: "We'll do an on-site measurement before final contract to verify."

**Script:**
"Great question. This AI estimates square footage from photos—it's typically within 5-10% of actual. You can see it gave this a [High/Medium] confidence score. Before you sign anything, we'll do an on-site measurement to lock in the exact number. This gives you a very good ballpark to make decisions."

### "Why should I choose metal if it costs more?"

**Don't:**
- Push product they don't want
- Ignore their budget concerns

**Do:**
- Show 30-year comparison: "Look at this total cost of ownership..."
- Explain insurance savings: "You save $XXX/year on insurance—that's real money."
- Highlight longevity: "You'll never replace it again. Zero re-roof costs."

**Script:**
"Look at this 30-year analysis. Metal costs $X,XXX upfront, but you save $Y,YYY on insurance over 30 years, $Z,ZZZ on energy, and you never pay for another roof. Total cost: $AAA. Compare that to architectural at $BBB upfront, but you replace it once in 30 years for another $BBB, minus smaller insurance savings. Total: $CCC. Metal actually costs LESS long-term if you're staying."

## Quality Assurance: When to Double-Check

### Red Flags to Verify

**If iTCR estimates seem off:**
- [ ] Square footage >5,000 or <800 (unusually large or small)
- [ ] Total cost seems way high or low for property
- [ ] Confidence score is Low
- [ ] Measurement significantly different from your visual estimate

**Action:** Request on-site measurement before presenting to customer.

### Edge Cases to Escalate

**Don't try to use iTCR for:**
- Commercial properties
- Historical homes with unique architecture
- Extreme pitch (12/12 or steeper)
- Visible structural damage
- Partial replacements or repairs only

**Action:** Escalate to senior estimator for manual quote.

### Customer Concerns to Escalate

**If customer:**
- Questions estimates that seem accurate to you
- Has prior quotes that differ by >25%
- Shows signs of major distrust
- Has unusual requirements not covered

**Action:** Offer on-site consultation with senior estimator.

## Troubleshooting

### "iTCR says it can't estimate this roof"

**Likely Reasons:**
- Photos insufficient (need overhead view)
- Roof too complex
- Commercial property

**Solution:**
1. Try getting better photos (overhead, clear view)
2. Provide more context: "This is a standard 1-story home with 2 valleys"
3. If still fails, use manual estimation

### "The square footage seems wrong"

**Check:**
- Did iTCR identify correct reference objects?
- Did you provide enough context about property size?
- Is confidence score Low?

**Solution:**
1. Tell iTCR about reference objects: "The car in the driveway is 16 feet for reference"
2. Provide context: "This is a 2,000 sq ft home, roughly 40×50 footprint"
3. Accept Low confidence and note "subject to on-site verification"

### "Customer doesn't understand the quote"

**Common Issues:**
- Too much information
- ROI analysis confusing
- Wants "just the bottom line"

**Solution:**
1. Simplify: Focus on the comparison table (upfront cost, 30-year cost, lifespan)
2. Highlight what matters: "Here's upfront cost, here's total cost over 30 years including savings"
3. Answer "why": "The difference is insurance savings and not replacing it again"

### "iTCR is taking too long"

**Typical Time:** 3-5 minutes for full multi-product quote

**If Longer:**
- Complex property (many products, detailed analysis)
- Large images (slow to upload)
- ChatGPT server load

**Solution:**
- Wait it out (usually completes)
- If >10 minutes, refresh and try again
- Worst case: Use manual estimation

**Situation:** Customer had hail damage, insurance paying, concerned about future claims

**iTCR Usage:**
- Uploaded Google Maps satellite view
- Provided zip 78703 (high hail area)
- Noted customer priority: "future hail protection"

**iTCR Recommendation:**
- Primary: Class 4 metal ($32,000)
- Alternative: Impact-rated architectural ($18,000)

**Outcome:**
- Customer chose metal after seeing 25% insurance discount ($500/year savings)
- Realized payback period was 14 years, staying 20+ years
- Happy with transparency and long-term value analysis

**Key Insight:** ROI analysis closed the sale—customer wouldn't have considered metal based on upfront cost alone.

### Example 2: Budget-Conscious Customer

**Situation:** Customer's 20-year-old roof failing, limited budget, retiring soon

**iTCR Usage:**
- Photos from property listing (house for sale earlier)
- Noted customer: "budget priority, selling in 5 years"

**iTCR Recommendation:**
- Primary: 3-tab shingles ($9,500)
- Alternative: Architectural ($12,800)

**Outcome:**
- Customer chose 3-tab
- Appreciated seeing the $3,300 savings
- Understood trade-offs (shorter lifespan) but fit needs
- Closed same day

**Key Insight:** Showing both options let customer make informed choice without feeling "sold" the cheapest option.
