## Short Footer (if space constrained)

Generated {created_at}. Valid until {valid_until} (7 business days). Estimate only; final scope confirmed on-site. Version {quote_disclaimer_version}.

## Implementation Notes

- Use standard footer unless PDF space is critically limited
- Ensure footer doesn't overlap existing content
- Test footer visibility on both letter and A4 paper sizes
- Footer font size should be readable but smaller than body (8-10pt recommended)
